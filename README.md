# Dementia-Screening-Games
A game-based cognitive assessment system designed for early dementia screening using interactive memory, attention, and logic games.
Dementia Screening Games is an interactive digital platform that evaluates cognitive performance using gamified activities. Instead of traditional questionnaire-based screening methods, this system uses engaging gameplay to collect performance metrics and provide a preliminary cognitive assessment.

The goal of this project is to make early-stage dementia screening more accessible, stress-free, and user-friendly.
